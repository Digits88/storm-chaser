		<p>Tim Samaras sat in the front passenger seat of the white Chevrolet Cobalt, considering the next move in a storm chaser’s game of cat-and-mouse with the massive tornado that thundered across the landscape. The 55-year-old Coloradan,  an iconic figure in this subculture who straddled celebrity and serious research, worked from a time-tested playbook: determine the tornado’s path, carefully maneuver his vehicle ahead of it, deploy three probes of his own invention to collect close-range data and then scamper out of the way.</p>

		<p>Next to Samaras, Carl Young gripped the steering wheel as he controlled a camcorder that captured their running dialogue -- a mixture of storm narration, navigational give-and-take and unwelcome driving tips. Though less renowned than Samaras among the general public, Young, 45, carried considerable cache within the storm-chasing community as a meticulous forecaster, a researcher of unsurpassed devotion and an engaging personality. </p>
		<p>Paul Samaras, Tim’s 24-year-old son, sat silent in the back seat, audibly detached from the scenes he was videotaping with his own equipment. Though he had no speaking part in this portion of the day’s drama, his very presence spoke to the way his emerging talents had happily intersected his father’s passion. </p>

		<p>They skirted the edge of mayhem along with dozens of other chasers, some also intent on taking measure of the tornado’s elusive, evolving parameters. Others buzzed the area on a meteorological thrill ride, video cameras in hand, venturing as close as they dared to shoot images that in short order would find a worldwide audience through social media and on the Internet.</p>

		<p>Storm chasers of every stripe converged on Friday May 31, 2013, drawn by the promise of exactly what now unfolded -- a breathtaking tornado of monumental proportions. Their very presence highlighted the sometimes dangerous intersection of meteorological inquiry and extreme sport, when chasers and locals turn out in critical mass to stalk often unpredictable and potentially lethal twisters.</p>
		<p>This supercell thunderstorm, an imposing natural undertaking that spawned vortices spinning within vortices like tornadic Russian nesting dolls, raced along with gathering speed. A terrifying, beautiful thing to behold.</p>
		<p>“Are you in movie mode?” Samaras said, as Young handed him his video camera.</p>
		<p>“Yeah,” Young replied. “Make sure it’s in focus.”</p>

		<p>“OK, we’ve gotta be careful in case this thing wraps up,” he said, fearing that the tornado could initiate a gradual left turn. “I would slow up here, ’cause if this thing started moving to the north, we’re in trouble. Slow up. We’re almost right along side of it here. Slow up! Let the thing go off to the east a little bit, see if that thing transverses us.”</p>

		<p>They probably did not realize that they already had ventured into the transparent edge of the tornado’s rotation. Sub-vortices &mdash; the classic visible incarnations of twisters &mdash; ripped across fields to the south. In the moment, Young saw opportunity beckon.</p>
		<p>“We can pass it right now, Tim,” he said. “It’s no problem. Really. I mean, I have a clear shot.”</p>
        <p>“We’ve got debris in the air,” said Samaras, and the loud thud of an object striking the car punctuated his words. “That’s the problem.”</p>
        <p>Just ahead, the intersection of Reformatory Road offered an escape valve. </p>
        <p>“Very large hail,” Samaras said. “OK, we’ve got, we’ve got a turn to the north which is good. Got this inflow jet, so we’re gonna follow it around to the north and get outta here. Now we go up north and then east.”</p>

		<p>Moments later, caution kicked in. Samaras, who’d spent decades stalking storms and anticipating their petulant behavior, sensed trouble. Even as the Cobalt churned through the wind in an effort to outrun the storm so they could place the probes, Samaras reconsidered their speed and course, calculating whether it would be wise to hang back and let the tornado pass in front of them.</p>

		<p>The lot is on the corner of a government-owned trespasser's haunt, every bedding place ruined by broken glass and crumbling concrete. The squalor is offset by a few good memories, though. Months and many homeless camping spots ago, she slept here with Josiah, her soulmate in love and drugs.</p>
		<p>Behind the wheel, Young felt the Cobalt straining against winds that likely topped 70 mph. Though they assumed this to be inflow, the wind produced as the tornado sucked air into its expanding rotation, in fact it was the larger circulation of the tornado itself.</p>
		<p>Samaras plotted a new course. They would head north on Reformatory and give the tornado a wide berth. Then they would resume the chase to the east, making up lost time as the funnels carved meandering arcs across the countryside. </p>
		<p>It was the smart play, the safe play. It was the strategy that, on almost any day in Tornado Alley, would offer the best chance to intercept the tornado on their own terms, to plant the probes and &mdash; with some luck &mdash; reap the potentially huge research benefits of a calculated risk.</p>
		<p>Young’s camcorder rolled, collecting images and capturing some of the last verbal exchanges among the storm chasers in the car before the beast suddenly turned on them.</p>

		<p class="lead">The early intimations of the weather event that eventually would take the lives of the three storm chasers appeared several days earlier as bending imaginary lines on a map, shifting elements wavering between unstable opposites: warm and cool, up and down, strong and weak. </p>
		<p>Five days out, those lines intersected in a way that provoked both alarm and excitement. A north-south dry line, the invisible border between moist air rising from the Gulf of Mexico and the arid air pushing from the west, crossed a stationary front due west of El Reno, Okla. The setup suggested major, violent storms, Frankenstein’s monster waiting for a convergence of optimal winds, pent-up energy and temperature to provide a life-affirming jolt.</p>
		<p>Conditions had been similar in the prelude to the May 20 tornado that devastated nearby Moore, just to the south of Oklahoma City, and killed two dozen people while injuring hundreds. Now all signs pointed to May 31, when the atmosphere would be primed to explode once again in this annual severe weather corridor.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, on the highways and backroads of the Midwest, other lines converged. Storm chasers, a community of severe weather junkies, plotted routes toward Oklahoma City – drawn by the promise of a meteorological performance of a magnitude that occurs fewer than a half-dozen times a season.</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="lead">Tim Samaras, like many of them, had been touring the region for weeks.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>A largely self-taught scientist with a resume that encompassed both academia and entertainment – and a reputation for caution and safety – Samaras in some ways seemed the last storm chaser who would run afoul of a tornado.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<div class="large-4 columns">
		<p>Chasers run the gamut, from arms-length observers to adrenaline addicts whose enthusiasm and pursuit of extreme video outpaces their judgment. But Samaras had tracked supercells for more than 30 years, from day trips on Colorado’s eastern plains with his younger brother, Jim, to the scientific expeditions that came to define his professional life.</p>

	<div class="large-4 columns pull-4">
		<img src="./img/chaser-05.jpg" style="width:100%"><p class="small">Most storm chasers seem to spend in inordinate amount of time in cars, driving around and stuff. Those cars clearly need a lot of attention because of all the extras stuff on them, too. (Another one with no credit)</p>

		<p>“It was about a fascination,” said 53-year-old Jim Samaras. “He had a strong passion for it. He decided to go out there with minimal training, just like a lot of them did in those days. He understood enough about air currents that he knew what to look for.”</p>
		<p>Eventually, day trips turned into week-long roadies. Jim stayed behind, unable to break away from work, while he watched his older brother’s interest grow into full-blown scientific inquiries. That probing, problem-solving approach drove Samaras from the time he was a kid growing up in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, transfixed by annual airings of “The Wizard of Oz.” He would walk away from the movie after the tornado scene.</p>
		<p>Though barely more than an average student, Samaras loved to learn on his own. He would plow through do-it-yourself Radio Shack electronic project kits and then move on to a new challenge. One year, his father put an ad in the newspaper seeking old, free electronic equipment, then drove around picking it up in his truck before piling it in Tim’s room and telling him, “Merry Christmas.” Most of the items were old radios, which Samaras methodically dismantled and reassembled. In the process, he cultivated an interest in HAM radio, learned Morse code and, in his early teens, earned his operator’s license.</p>
		<p>After graduating from Alameda High School in 1976, he took a job fixing electronics. A few years later, he started working at the University of Denver, where he shot high-speed photographs of explosions. His affinity for photography stemmed at least in part from his dad, who did professional wedding photography when he wasn’t managing his hobby store.</p>
		<p>Before he left DU, Samaras claimed a massive old high-speed camera, an outdated analog device that shot 50,000 frames per second. He retooled it to shoot one million frames per second, dubbed it the Big Kahuna and lugged it all across the country -- and in May to Oklahoma -- to study lightning.</p>
		<p>He worked for Applied Research Associates, a scientific research and engineering firm, for a decade and honed his engineering skills there on a variety of projects, from the barometric pressure-measuring probes he would later employ in storm chasing to the crash investigation of TWA Flight 800 in 1996.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<div class="large-4 columns">
		<p>From there, he launched the research group known simply as TWISTEX – short for Tactical Weather Instrumented Sampling in/near Tornadoes Experiment. It became the definitive outlet that combined his passion for weather with his drive to tinker and build.</p>

		<p>Samaras somehow always managed to lash together his talents in the pursuit of both a living and his passions. He invested in real estate. Jim showed him how to “flip” houses. Two years ago, he found an ideal property for himself and his wife, Kathy -- a foreclosure on some acreage out on the eastern plains in Bennett where he’d have plenty of room and could put up radio and weather towers without irking the neighbors. Plus, he had room for a full machine shop where he could breathe life into his ideas.</p>
		<p>In recent months, Paul had become a fixture on TWISTEX road trips as his budding interest in photography and videography merged with his father’s passion for severe weather. But while Tim already had attained standing, Paul remained a promising work in progress. Though quiet and shy, Paul had begun to emerge from his shell as his work began to distinguish itself. </p>
		<p>Paul’s presence in the field could only have heightened Tim’s commitment to safety, colleagues said. They have pointed out that though Samaras’ data collection techniques required venturing uncomfortably close to the twisters, the urgency of the project never took precedence over safety – even if it meant a missed opportunity.</p>
		<p>Ed Grubb, a storm chaser from Thornton, had spent a week in mid-May with Samaras chasing tornadoes across the Midwest. Their very first encounter came on May 18 near the central Kansas town of Rozel, where a storm produced a captivating tornado and Samaras saw a chance to deploy some data-gathering instruments by driving in from behind it on an unpaved route. </p>
		<p>“But the roads were so muddy that he said, ‘No, we’re not going to do that,’” Grubb recalled. “Then we went back east and tried to circle back around on asphalt and couldn’t get into position before it broke down and dissipated.”</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="lead">Samaras waxed philosophical on these occasions. They would chase again another day.</p>
		<p>The mid-May storm chasing exercise had been an official mission of TWISTEX. The last week in May began three weeks doing lightning research for National Geographic, which had funded Samaras’ field work 18 times over the years. </p>
		<p>They had a heavy truck that held the equipment for the nighttime sessions shooting lightning. But they also brought along another vehicle from the TWISTEX fleet, a Chevy Cobalt dubbed M3, a smaller and more gas-friendly vehicle often used as part of their storm chasing team. </p>
		<p>On MSNBC, just hours before the weather system exploded on the Oklahoma plains, Tim Samaras’ voice over the phone explained to the anchors – and to the viewing audience – in plain language what the coming day held.</p>
		<p>“Right now, the skies are fairly clear,” he said. “We do not have storm initiation but we fully expect storm initiation probably within the next two or three hours. Boy, the ingredients are coming together for a pretty volatile day.”</p>
