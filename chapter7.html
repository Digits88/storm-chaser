		<p class="lead">The deaths of Tim Samaras, Carl Young and Paul Samaras, regarded as the first to be killed by a tornado among what many colleagues consider &ldquo;bonafide&rdquo; storm chasers, brought renewed attention to these weather enthusiasts, to their scientific contributions and to the hazards they face &mdash; and pose &mdash; wherever twisters materialize.</p>
		<p>They also highlighted the personal and professional loss inflicted on a community in which all three had become valued contributors.</p>
		<p>John Francis, the National Geographic Society&rsquo;s vice president for research, conservation and exploration, called the organization&rsquo;s funding of Samaras &ldquo;venture capital for science&rdquo; in which it placed bets on promising research from which others might have shied away.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It pays off a lot, and Tim is a case in point,&rdquo; Francis said. &ldquo;I think any time somebody can devise a way to get into a tornado the way he did, with his unique instrumentation, and to provide that unique perspective that seems almost impossible, to me that&rsquo;s emblematic of what&rsquo;s wonderful about exploration.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>To family, the Samaras men left a different sort of legacy.</p>

		<p>Tim&rsquo;s daughters, Jennifer and Amy, recalled how his intelligence resonated and his support never wavered through dance recitals, gymnastics and even a run for 6th grade class president. How no problem was too inconsequential to deserve their father&rsquo;s full attention, even if it involved setting up a video camera to prove the existence of Santa Claus. (Something unexplained would always happen to foil the attempt.)</p>
		<p>The more reserved Paul displayed an offbeat sense of humor and a creative streak behind the camera &mdash; he videotaped both of his sisters&rsquo; weddings &mdash; that led his passion to merge with his father&rsquo;s. Recently, he vowed to shave his trademark beard if the crew managed to successfully deploy a probe.</p>
		<p>When, as a child, Amy assumed the role of Dorothy in her elementary school&rsquo;s production of &ldquo;The Wizard of Oz,&rdquo; her father employed red glitter to transform a pair of tennis shoes into ruby red slippers. Kathy, his wife, also recognized an almost fairy-tale aura to her own life.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I felt like I was Cinderella for the 31 years I was married to him,&rdquo; she said at the Denver-area memorial where several hundred people paid respects to her husband and son. &ldquo;He was my best friend...You know Tim, nothing stopped him. He found a way, he found some way to fix something, do something, you could never tell that man ‘no.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t in his vocabulary.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Another man spoke of loss at the memorial. Matt Winter had grown up as the only one in his family fascinated by weather, and storm chasing in particular. He had followed Tim Samaras from afar, celebrating his achievements, until what he described only as &ldquo;a certain set of circumstances&rdquo; in 2006 revealed that Samaras was &mdash; much to their mutual surprise &mdash; his father.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="large-8 columns">
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the odds are of those events ever taking place,&rdquo; said Winter, now in his mid-30s, &ldquo;but we connected with that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>After only a few years, that connection &mdash; as well as what he considered an especially strong bond with half-brother Paul &mdash; was lost, though he remains grateful that the entire Samaras family accepted him into their lives.</p>
		<p>In California, Bob Young reflected on his son&rsquo;s storm chasing career and the risks involved, all now folded within an overwhelming grief shared by his ex-wife and her husband, Ada and Sal Lucido, and Carl&rsquo;s younger brother Eric.</p>
		<p>For Bob, who had basically shared his South Lake Tahoe, Calif., house with his older son for the last 17 years, had traveled the country with him and seen their relationship reborn, the sense of loss hangs heavy in a very particular way.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Young, &ldquo;Carl was my life.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They had talked before about the dangers of storm chasing, especially the risk involved with placing probes, and Bob had urged him to be careful. At the same time, he knew both his son and Samaras to be cautious in the field.</p>
		<p>The tragic turn of events only began to make sense as information about the tornado emerged, data describing its uncommon speed and unprecedented expansion, its sudden turn to the north, its beehive of sub-vortices. Explanation of the twister&rsquo;s behavior left only questions about the storm chasers&rsquo; movements to complete the picture.</p>
		<p>Many of those could be answered by Carl&rsquo;s video. The remaining gaps, including any accounting of the three men&rsquo;s last minutes, are voids of conjecture, supposition and heartache. How do you reconcile that kind of loss?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They were soldiers who went off to war,&rdquo; said Young. &ldquo;And they were killed trying to give people the ability to have advance knowledge on tornadoes. They put themselves in danger for scientific reasons, for humanitarian reasons. So yeah, they went off to war and were killed. That&rsquo;s kinda the way I look at it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>To Gabe Garfield, who has examined the 40-minute lifespan of the El Reno tornado as closely as anyone, there were dozens of chasers who at some point stood mere seconds from death themselves. He called the tragedy a &ldquo;seminal moment&rdquo; for storm chasers as a sobering, cautionary tale. But he also acknowledged that such a safety message inevitably loses potency over time.</p>
		<p>Dan Robinson, whose car outran probable death by a mere 28 seconds on the same road where the TWISTEX crew died, said his close call will inform his future chases and remind him to keep a broader buffer from such tornadoes. He compared his photo and video-gathering expeditions to a safari: &ldquo;You go to see the lions and cheetahs, you want to see nature in action. But you don&rsquo;t want to get out of the safety of your vehicle and walk right up to the wild animals.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>As a researcher long dialed in to tornadoes as the product of measurable meteorological circumstances, Garfield hasn&rsquo;t thought of them as creatures, even in the abstract, since childhood. And yet, the El Reno event, which almost literally turned its hunters into the hunted, suggested something awesome and powerful sprung to life.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This tornado tried to swallow up everybody along its path,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In that sense, you can&rsquo;t help but think of it being a beast. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to describe it than to say it was a monster.&rdquo;</p>
