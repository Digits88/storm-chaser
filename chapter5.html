		<h1>&ldquo;Here we go&rdquo;</h1>
		<p class="lead">About 3 miles to the north, Tim Samaras, his son Paul and Carl Young, having veered away from a close call with the tornado just moments earlier on Reno Street, cruised north on Reformatory Road.</p>
		<p>Samaras answered his cellphone &mdash; an apparent media call that, despite the pressures of the pursuit, he responded to with a quick assessment of what he predicted to be a &ldquo;long-lived tornado.&rdquo; As he talked, the Cobalt turned east onto Reuter Road, another of the unpaved routes that criss-cross the expanse of farm fields.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; said Young. &ldquo;Here we go. Should get a view of it again.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The chase resumed, with the TWISTEX crew tracking the tornado to the south and moving east at a good clip. Meanwhile, a shroud of precipitation descended between the tornado and the Cobalt as Young guided it along Reuter Road.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s pretty well rain-wrapped now,&rdquo; Samaras said. &ldquo;In fact, it&rsquo;s hard to tell what the hell it&rsquo;s doing now. Probably just a gigantic wedge, we can&rsquo;t see it anymore. ... OK, stop sign up here.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I see it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While Samaras chipped in driving tips and Young deflected them, they continued tracking the tornado that appeared less distinct against the gauzy wall of rain. A blast of wind shuddered the vehicle.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What a beast,&rdquo; Samaras said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just doing everything we can to keep up with this thing.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re probably going to have to cross 81, if this road is good,&rdquo; Samaras continued, &ldquo;and then try and drop down if we&rsquo;ve got some viable roads.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They pulled up to the intersection of Reuter and U.S. 81 behind a Toyota Yaris and watched it cross the divided highway. The Cobalt followed. Although the road was dry, rain to the south made it difficult to discern the twister&rsquo;s movement, much less the violently skittering sub-vortices within.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This thing is moving 40 miles an hour, 30-40 miles an hour to the east,&rdquo; Samaras said, sensing that the tornado&rsquo;s speed had picked up.</p>
		<p>His rough calculation was nearly accurate, except for one thing: the tornado&rsquo;s rapid expansion, to a record 2.6 miles wide, effectively meant that it was closing at a much higher speed &mdash; something closer to 50 mph. The Cobalt, with four cylinders and 155 horsepower, carried three passengers, three 45-pound probes and other equipment, straining against rising winds.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now I see it,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;Well, maybe I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The tornado had taken a sharp turn to the north and enveloped them. Even had they been monitoring radar images broadcast by the National Weather Service, they wouldn&rsquo;t have seen this coming. The radar scans went out at five-minute intervals. The tornado turned on a dime in between scans.</p>
		<p>They crossed Alfadale Road a mile east of U.S. 81. The grid of rural byways offered no options between Alfadale and Radio roads, where the Cobalt became vulnerable to the manic sub-vortices whose wind speeds packed the most lethal power.</p>
		<p>The video camera switched off.</p>
		<p>By later estimates, the three men had perhaps 90 seconds to live.</p>
		<h1>28 seconds</h1>
		<p class="lead">Like the TWISTEX folks with whom he had only a passing acquaintance, Dan Robinson minutes earlier had been tracking the El Reno tornado from the north. His route took him east along West Jensen Road, which cuts across the town&rsquo;s southern edge.</p>

		<p>As he drove, he saw the supercell thunderstorm moving southeast, pulling farther away from his path. So he veered south a mile and then turned east again on Reuter Road. Almost as soon as he made the turn onto Reuter, a white Chevy Cobalt appeared in his rearview mirror.</p>
		<p>But for Robinson &mdash; absorbed in his pursuit of the tornado &mdash; this development was, at that moment, barely noticed and of no particular import.</p>
		<p>He had taken a week off from his job doing website design, left his home in New Baden, Ill., and headed west for the frenetic close of storm-chasing season. This would be his last day in the field, chasing and shooting video from three cameras mounted in his car, before heading back home just outside the St. Louis metro area.</p>
		<p>Robinson slowed to a stop where Reuter Road intersected U.S. 81. He judged the tornado to be about a mile and a half to the south, and briefly considered venturing closer by turning south on U.S. 81.</p>
		<p>But now the tornado seemed to be closing. He pulled through the intersection and continued east. Meanwhile, the headlights of the white Cobalt rolled up to the stop sign, hesitated, and then continued on behind him.</p>
		<p>About a half-mile down the road, Robinson sensed the rain curtain advancing on him in a hurry and jolted to the realization that he might be in trouble. The tornado, cloaked in precipitation, had punched the accelerator. Now Robinson did the same, but with frighteningly little effect.</p>
		<p>He faced a triple-whammy: rocky road, headwinds from the tornado&rsquo;s outer circulation &mdash; sustained speeds of at least 65 mph, probably closer to 90 &mdash; and a traction-control setting on his Yaris that suddenly seemed to be working at cross-purposes to his escape.</p>
		<p>The traction control, designed to keep wheels from spinning in slippery conditions, reduced his power on the yielding gravel. Robinson couldn&rsquo;t coax the car to anything above 45 mph, all the while flooring the accelerator and backing off, flooring it and backing off, while he fumbled to try to deactivate the feature.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was in full panic mode,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I was definitely very concerned. I knew this was a bad situation and I needed to get out of it at all costs.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He blew through three stop signs where, thankfully, there was none of the congestion that had built on other roads in the area. Where was the tornado now? Even that had faded into irrelevance. Escape was all that mattered and there seemed only one way out &mdash; forward. He did not notice that the headlights trailing him had disappeared behind sheets of wind-lashed rain.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Robinson emerged from the curtain of wind and precipitation. He drove another thousand feet or so and finally stopped to look back. Judging himself out of danger, he grabbed his camera and started shooting pictures. The tornado edged toward him. He got back in the car, drove a little farther on, stepped outside to take more photos.</p>
		<p>Then the hail arrived, golf-ball size. One hailstone struck him just above his left eye, stunning him and producing a bloody gash. He dived into a roadside ditch with the split-second reasoning that if his car rolled in the sudden high winds, he didn&rsquo;t want to be near it. The hail subsided less than a minute later, but not before the car&rsquo;s rear window had been blown out.</p>
		<p>That damage was recorded by Robinson&rsquo;s rear-facing camera, the same one that had captured the Cobalt driving behind him. Days later, examining the video, Robinson would watch as both cars crossed Alfadale Road. Then he would put a stopwatch to the segment. The Cobalt crossed the intersection exactly 28 seconds behind him. Its headlights disappeared from view behind sheets of heavy rain at 6:22 p.m.</p>
		<p>At the time, hurt and bleeding next to his hail-ravaged Yaris, Robinson didn&rsquo;t realize exactly how lucky he&rsquo;d been. He stood alone amid the wind-raked fields of central Oklahoma, unable to see a single vehicle ahead or behind him.</p>
